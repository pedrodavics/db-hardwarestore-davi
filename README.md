## OBJECTIVE -
The objective of this project is to create a relational database for a hardware store, allowing the management of customers, suppliers, products, orders, deliveries, and drivers. The database was developed to meet the business's needs, enabling the execution of queries and the generation of relevant reports.

## BUSINESS MODEL -
The business model of the hardware store involves selling products to customers, who place purchase orders. The products are supplied by different vendors. After the order is confirmed, deliveries are scheduled and carried out by hired drivers. The database aims to centralize and organize all this information to facilitate management and report generation.

## PROBLEM SITUATION -
The store faces challenges related to the efficient management of information and the coordination of deliveries. The lack of a structured database system can result in difficulties in organizing customer, supplier, product, delivery, and order information, as well as communication between the various parties involved in the process, such as suppliers and third-party drivers. Addressing these issues is crucial to ensuring the store's smooth operation, customer satisfaction, and the ability to make strategic decisions based on reliable data.
